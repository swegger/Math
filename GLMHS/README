Code is used to implement and fit a general linear model with hidden state that evolves according to a linear dynamical system. The general form of the model is as follows:

(1) Observable neural activity, x, is driven by a hidden state, z according to
lambda = exp( Cz )

where C is a matrix determining the linear relationship between hidden states and neural activity, which is followed by an exponential nonlinearity to generate the activation function, lambda. Spike counts are a stochastically generated by a Poisson process:

p(n|lambda) = lambda^k * exp(-lambda) / k!

(2) The hidden state, z, evolves according to a set of linear Gaussian equations:
z(t+dt) = Az(t) + eta(t)

where eta is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with covariance Gamma.
